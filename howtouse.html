<h3 style="text-align:center;">How to use</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify";> Currently it is possible to check the gene names for humans, mice and rats using the following identifiers: <a href="https://www.genenames.org/about/">SYMBOL</a> ,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/">ENTREZID</a>  and <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/index.html">ENSEMBL</a>.</p>
<p>Identifiers must be typed separated by SPACES or ENTERS. If the following error message appears written in red <em>"None of the keys entered are valid keys for 'SYMBOL'. Please use the keys method to see a listing of valid arguments."</em>, it means that the first gene searched for was not found in the database and that it was probably written incorrectly. When the search contains multiple genes, those that are incorrect have blank lines for the remaining columns.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">How to format gene symbols</h4>
<p>Greek letters are never used, as well as hyphens.Gene symbols should be italicized (When referring to proteins, the same symbols should be used, but not italicized).For human genes the symbols should be written in capital letters, while for mouse and rat only the first letter should be capitalized.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p><b>Human:</b> <em>BGLAP</em></p>
<p><b>Mouse:</b> <em>Bglap</em></p>
<p><b>Rat:</b> <em>Bglap</em></p>
